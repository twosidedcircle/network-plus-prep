**Study steps are:** 
1. Set up ChatGPT chat session with this prompt: "Do the following for each new transcript I paste in: format the following transcript into double-sided study cards (front/back style) for use in a flashcard app Anki and export these into a CSV file (ready for Anki import)."
2. Watch a video. 
3. Copy/paste transcript into existing ChatGPT chat session.
4. Download generated CSV file.
5. Import CSV into Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/), manually selecting "comma" as the delimiter.
6. Run through all the flash cards once, selecting <10 minutes for each card, even if you know the answer. Select the shorter durations for more challenging cards.
7. Once cards have been fully reviewed, work through them marking well known answers for review in later days. Repeat until all cards are well known.
8. Move on to next video.
9. Allow enough time in daily study for additional review of all cards from all reviewed sections for that day. Do this by resetting all cards for those sections. Cards should then be reviewed as a whole in the scheduled follow up times.
